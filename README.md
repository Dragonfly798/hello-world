# hello-world
First ever repository! 

This is my first time using Github and i'm finding that this in a hella interesting site.I'm new to this technology game but excited and can't wait to dive into this. I would like to one day create my own database which ponders on the question of chinese medicine. How can these databases be used to find, collect, and interpret information that is not readily searchabl? The numerous private clinics have to no centralized database for future generations to pull information in a meaningful way, I'm hoping to change this. To bring into the modern fold, the data which exists in traditional clinics and turn them onto the game of data collection. The ultimate goal would be to create a repository of information from these old healers from around the world to share their clinic experiences so that future generations will be able to look up this information. Not meant to be just for the use of traditional healers but perhaps even a referrence database for everyone.
